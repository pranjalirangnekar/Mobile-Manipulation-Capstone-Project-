# ðŸš€ Mobile Manipulation Capstone Project

This **GitHub repository** contains the **comprehensive work** completed for the **Mobile Manipulation Capstone Project**, part of the **"Modern Robotics" Specialization** offered by **Northwestern University** on **Coursera**.

This project focuses on designing and implementing a **mobile manipulator robot** named **youBot**, which autonomously performs tasks such as:
- **Navigating a virtual environment**  
- **Picking up and relocating a block**  
- **Following a sophisticated trajectory**  

---

## ðŸ”¹ **Project Overview**
This project integrates multiple robotic principles using the **Modern Robotics Code Library**:

âœ… **Kinematics** â€“ Calculates joint positions and orientations.  
âœ… **Dynamics** â€“ Ensures smooth motion through force and torque calculations.  
âœ… **Control** â€“ Executes precise trajectories for manipulation tasks.  

The robot is programmed to:
1. **Identify & approach a block**
2. **Adjust its manipulator for an optimal grip**
3. **Transport the block to a target location**
4. **Avoid obstacles** while moving

The project concludes with a **CSV file** that captures the **youBotâ€™s configurations** at various timestamps. This data is used in **CoppeliaSim** to demonstrate real-time task execution.
