This GitHub repository contains the comprehensive work done on the Mobile Manipulation Capstone project as part of the "Modern Robotics" Coursera Specialization offered by Northwestern University. This capstone project focuses on the design and implementation of a mobile manipulator robot named the youBot. The project's main goal is to autonomously control the youBot to achieve specific tasks such as navigating a virtual environment, picking up, and relocating a block using a sophisticated trajectory.

Leveraging the Modern Robotics code library, the project integrates various robotic principles including kinematics, dynamics, and control. The robot is programmed to calculate and execute a path that allows it to approach the block, adjust its manipulator for optimal grip, and transport the block to a new location while avoiding obstacles.

The culmination of the project is the generation of a CSV file capturing the youBot's configurations at different timestamps, which drives the simulation in the CoppeliaSim environment to demonstrate the robot's task execution capabilities effectively. The repository also includes detailed documentation and code, providing insights into the computational approaches and algorithms utilized to control the youBot.
